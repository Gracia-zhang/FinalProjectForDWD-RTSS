# FinalProjectForDWD-RTSS
 
I want to build a web app that allows people talk one on one with audio and avatars. Also, I want it to be adorable and relaxing so I choose a tv-head person as the base of avatar.

→ for friends and friendly strangers
→ no video (for comfort)
→ using customized avatar as yourself
